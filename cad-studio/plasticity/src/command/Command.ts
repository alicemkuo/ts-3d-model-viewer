/**
 * Commands have two responsibilities. They are usually a step-by-step interactive workflow for geometrical
 * operations, like creating a cylinder. But they also encapsulate any state change that needs to be atomic,
 * for the purposes of UNDO. Thus, selection changes are also commands.
 * 
 * For the most part, a Command is a user-friendly wrapper around a Factory. The factory actually creates 
 * geometrical objects and adds them to the database. Whereas the Command shows the users a dialog box,
 * interactive gizmos, etc. While the user interacts with the gizmo or dialog fields, the factory is
 * "updated". When the user is finished the factory is "committed".
 * 
 * Commands can be written such that they complete immediately after the user's first interaction
 * (as in the Move command), or they can stick around allowing the user to refine values and finish
 * only when the user clicks "ok" (as in the Fillet command).
 * 
 * A key implementation detail of Commands is that they have "resources". Resources include gizmos, dialogs,
 * and factories. A resource represents something that can be "finished" or "cancelled." Modeling all of
 * these objects as resources makes it easy to clean-up a command when finishing or cancelling. Because
 * most resources deal with Promises, it's important to make sure all exceptions are handled. Normally,
 * `await gizmo.execute()` is most natural, but for more complicated commands, `await this.finished` is
 * an option.
