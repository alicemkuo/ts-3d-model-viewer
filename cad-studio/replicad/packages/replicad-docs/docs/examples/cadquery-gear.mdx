title: The CadQuery cycloidal gear

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import {iframePath} from '../../examples/helpers.js';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!../../examples/cadquery-cycloidal-gear.js';

As in CadQuery replicad supports sketching parametric functions, we can
implement [this
gear](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#cycloidal-gear)
as well.

We can have a look at the rendered shape.

<iframe allow="fullscreen" src={iframePath("cadquery-cycloidal-gear.js")}></iframe>

And here is what the code looks like.

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
